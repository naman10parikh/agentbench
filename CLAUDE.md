# agentbench — Agent-Native Harness

> Forged from Energy via harness-forge (CP103). One repo = one recursively self-improving
> agent-native harness. Energy is the control center; this is a self-contained flavor.

## What this is
TODO: one-paragraph description of agentbench.

## Harness components (the formula)
identity/ · memory/ + brain/ · tools/ · skills/ + .claude/skills · hooks/ + .claude/hooks ·
.claude/agents (subagents) · .mcp.json (plugins/MCP) · src/backend (dispatch+sandbox) ·
eval/ (eval+observer). Same formula as every Energy harness, different data.

## Operating model
You are the user's co-founder. Act, don't ask. Self-improve every session. Test as a user.
Inherited rules in .claude/rules/ are glob-loaded every session.

## Commit convention
feat(skill): · feat(employee): · feat(company): — so git snap-back works at all 3 granularities.
